# Simple Swarm Bots

## Overview

This project demonstrates the concept of swarm intelligence using three Makebot robots programmed with Scratch. The swarm consists of one master bot and two slave bots. The communication between the bots is centralized and limited, utilizing IR sensors integrated with Arduino controllers.

## Components

- **Makebot Development Kit**
- **3 Arduino Boards**
- **IR Sensors**
- **Motors**
- **Scratch Programming Environment**

## How It Works

1. **Master Bot**: The master bot coordinates the actions of the slave bots by sending commands through IR communication.
2. **Slave Bots**: The slave bots receive commands from the master bot and perform actions accordingly.
3. **IR Sensors**: The IR sensors are used for communication between the master and slave bots.
4. **Arduino Controllers**: Each bot is controlled by an Arduino board that processes the IR sensor data and executes the commands.
5. **Scratch Programming**: The Scratch program is used to write the communication and control logic for the bots.


## Steps to Build the Swarm Bots

1. **Assemble the Hardware**:
   - Set up the IR sensors on each bot.
   - Connect the Arduino boards to the IR sensors and motors.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and the components are properly powered.

2. **Set Up the Software**:
   - Install the Scratch programming environment on your computer.
   - Write the Scratch program to handle communication and control for the master and slave bots.
   - Upload the respective programs to the Arduino boards of the master and slave bots.

3. **Calibrate the Sensors**:
   - Ensure the IR sensors are properly calibrated for effective communication.

4. **Test and Adjust**:
   - Run the program and observe the bots' behavior.
   - Make necessary adjustments to the Scratch program to improve the communication and coordination of the swarm.
